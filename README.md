# TENG Test Setup

## Overview
This setup is used to measure the AC voltage generated from continuously separating and joining the two triboelectric layers. This is done by placing a layer on the top and base plate and using the rack & pinion mechanism + a MG996R servo to move the plates into each other.

## How to use the setup
